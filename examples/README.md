# EVE-MCU-Dev Examples

[Back](../README.md)

## Runnable Examples

In the example code the EVE-MCU-Dev library is compiled with the example program. 
The example `simple` is supported by all platforms and is intended to be used as a template for new projects.

The following example code is available:

| Folder | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [simple](simple/README.md) | Simple example code which demonstrates loading a bitmap and a legacy font. |
| [b2tf](b2tf/README.md) | Seven segment demo code using sevenseg code snippet. This shows a constantly updating screen with blends, scissors and gradients. |
| [cruise](cruise/README.md) | Circular click-wheel display demo code. This shows gradients and actions for user inputs. |
| [dronefpv-bt82x](dronefpv-bt82x/README.md) | Advanced BT82X demo seven segment demo code rendering video from the LVDS RX interface to the screen via a bitmap in RAM_G. |
| [flightdeck](flightdeck/README.md) | Drawing graphical representations of physical controls from an aircraft. Shows blending and gradients with smooth animation. |
| [fontmagic](fontmagic/README.md) | Simple example code demonstrating scaling and rotating letters from a font file. |

## Widgets and Utilities

In addition to runable demo code there are libraries of widgets and utilities that are used by the examples or help development.

| File/Folder | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [snippets](snippets/README.md) | Common files and widgets for the examples. |

Many of the examples load code or modules from this directory. 

TODO: this directory will be split into widgets and utilities.
