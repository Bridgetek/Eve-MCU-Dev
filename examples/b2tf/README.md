# EVE-MCU-Dev Advanced Seven Segment Example

[Back](../README.md)

## Advanced Seven Segment Example

The `b2tf` example demonstrates drawing multiple seven segment displays on the same screen. The `b2tf` code uses the `sevenseg` snippet from the [snippets](../snippets) directory to perform some of the drawing. 

The example is intended to show a three clocks, one in the past, one at the present and another which counts backward from the present clock time to the past clock time.

NOTE this example will work only on operating systems and compilers that provide a real time clock functionality includeing the `time.h` header file, `gmtime_s` and `mktime` functions.

### `main.c`

The application starts up in the file `main.c` which provides initial MCU configuration and then calls `eve_example.c` where the remainder of the application will be carried out. 

The `main.c` code is platform specific. It must provide any functions that rely on a platform's operating system, or built-in non-volatile storage mechanism. The required functions store and recall previous touch screen calibration settings:
- **platform_calib_init** initialise a platform's non-volatile storage system.
- **platform_calib_read** read a previous touch screen calibration or return a value indicating that there are no stored calibration setting.
- **platform_calib_write** write a touch screen calibration to the platform's non-volatile storage.

The example program in the common code is then called.

### `eve_example.c`

In the function `eve_example` the basic format is as follows:

```
void eve_example(void)
{
    uint32_t font_end;
    // Initialise the display
    EVE_Init();
    // Calibrate the display
    eve_calibrate();
    // Start example code
    eve_display();
 }
```
The call to `EVE_Init()` is made which sets up the EVE environment on the platform. This will initialise the SPI communications to the EVE device and set-up the device ready to receive communication from the host.

Next, the function `eve_calibrate()` is then called which uses the calibration co-processor command to display the calibration screen and asks the user to tap the three dots (see `eve_calibrate.c` below).

Once calibration is complete, the main loop is called which sits in a continuous loop within `eve_display()`. Each time round the loop, a screen is created using a co-processor list. 

### `eve_calibrate.c`

This function is used to show the touchscreen calibration screen and prompt the user to touch the screen at the required positions to generate an accurate transformation matrix. This matrix is used to translate the raw touch input into precise points on the screen.

The platform specific functions in `main.c` are called from this routine to store and read touchscreen calibration settings so that the user only needs to perform the action once.
